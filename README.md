Astro-Raising
Astro-Raising is a 2D pixel art platformer developed in Unity for web browsers. The player must ascend from the depths of a cave to the sky using a jetpack, dodging obstacles and managing their energy.

How to Play
The goal is to climb as high as possible without running out of energy. Obstacles can push you down or drain your energy, while boosts help you recover it.

Controls
Fly upward with the jetpack

Propel to the left in the air

Propel to the right in the air

Move left on the ground or in the air

Move right on the ground or in the air

The jetpack energy bar automatically recharges when the player is standing on a platform or on the ground.

Features
Progressive environments: from dark caves to the sky

Obstacles that hinder your ascent or drain energy

Boosts to recharge energy and move faster

Pixel art style with URP lighting

Playable directly in your web browser

Smooth controls on both ground and air
